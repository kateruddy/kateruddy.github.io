					<h3>Educational Experience</h3>
					<p>Starting from high school, my educational experience has certainly been non-traditional.</p>
					<p>From the ninth grade to the twelfth, I attended Walnut Hill School for the Arts in Natick, MA. I spent half of my school day there (from 8am to 2pm) studying typical high school topics like algebra, English, and biology; the other half (from 2 to 6pm) was spent immersed in the world of Musical Theatre. My nights (from 7 to 10pm) were spent in rehearsals, studying, or both at the same time.</p>
					<p>My senior year of high school was spent traveling around the country for college theatre program auditions — about twenty of them! After many essays written, flights taken, and rejection letters received, I committed to the B.A. Theatre Performance program at Wagner College on Staten Island.</p>
					<p>My semester spent in-person at Wagner was a fantastic experience — and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In February 2020, my entire college was sent home, and I took classes remotely for the Spring and Fall 2020 semesters. As one can imagine, Zoom theatre classes are a bit of a passion-killer.</p>
					<p>After the Fall 2020 semester, I took a semester off to both work and apply to transfer colleges. After another 11 college applications, I was accepted into Boston University's College of Communication for the Fall 2021 semester. I am now studying advertising and participating in clubs such as HerCampus, AdClub, and even the Daily Free Press, BU's independent newspaper. I now expect to graduate after the Fall 2023 semester.</p>

					<h3>Work Experience</h3>
					<p>Since June 2020, I have worked in multiple positions at the Captain Kidd Restaurant in Woods Hole, MA. Starting out as a hostess, I was quickly moved up to train as a server. I watched my summer co-workers return to school while I took online classes and learned to bartend. The next summer, our staff saw three managers be hired and quit in the span of three months, meaning that senior staff, such as myself, had to assume leadership roles as well as train the new management in the workings of the restaurant. This past summer, I managed the Captain Kidd's social media, served tables five days out of the week to save up for senior year, and acted as an assistant manager on the sixth.</p>
					<p>My other places of prior employment include Abercrombie and Fitch in Natick, MA, where I worked as a sales associate, The Boathouse at Pier 37 in Falmouth, MA, where I hostessed, and Tilly and Salvy's Bacon Street Farm in Natick, MA, where I scanned and bagged groceries.</p>
					<p>During the spring of 2020, I found myself with a significant amount of free time (as did many others), and decided to put it to use finding an acting agent. After submitting materials to a handful of agencies, I took interviews with a couple, and ended up signing a two-year contract with an agency based out of Newburyport, MA. My agent was instrumental in getting me auditions for projects both large and local. As anyone who has worked in the film industry knows, auditioning is half the battle, but I did get the opportunity to film a music video in the fall of 2020.</p>

					<h3>Other Experiences</h3>
					<p>Outside of school and work, I have other interests <span id="glinda">(as many do!)</span>. I still love musical theatre, although I've become an observer rather than a performer. I also love reading and am attempting to work my way through the <a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/all/" target="_blank">Time Top 100 books</a> list. My mom taught me to knit and embroider when I was young, and I now love making scarves and decorations for my family and friends.</p>
					<p>I have also enjoyed learning about subjects outside of my degree at BU, like computer science (I wrote this website myself!), French, and history.</p>
